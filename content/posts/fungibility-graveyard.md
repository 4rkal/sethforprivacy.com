# Introduction

Bitcoin is often touted as a fungible and private asset and digital cash alternative, when in fact it is technically non-fungible. Each bitcoin in circulation has a distinct history attached to it ensuring that 1BTC != 1BTC. While coin histories can be somewhat ofuscated with tools like CoinJoin, the fungibility of Bitcoin remains distinctly lacking.

Many Bitcoiners purport that fungibility can be gained through more users mixing, or by peer-pressuring and boycotting exchanges and services that flag or trace Bitcoin transactions. In theory this is possible (suppose in another universe, everyone mixes), but why leave it up to chance?

We see fungibility as a basic safety feature. Good tools should include safety features by default, strong enough to withstand both governmental and social attacks. This is far preferable to relying on the goodwill of governments and regulators, or the peer-pressure of us as users to ensure fungibility of digital cash. Do you really want your coins to be fungible only if your grandma correctly follows a 50 page mixing guide? And if arbitrage traders agree to mix between exchanges?

Monero relies on privacy by-default, for all users and all transactions, to ensure that 1XMR = 1XMR, no matter what. Monero is fungible today, not just in a pipe dream.

# The Fungibility Graveyard

Our concerns aren't only a fun thought exercise. Users of Bitcoin privacy tools are being harassed today.

Below is a list of sources confirming cases of flagging, denied withdrawals, denied deposits, and censorship by services because of a distinct lack of fungibility within Bitcoin. The list is broken down by the tool or reason for the flagging or censorship.
