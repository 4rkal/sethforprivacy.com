# Introduction

One of the most common questions I get from people who are starting to realize the need for personal privacy is "Where do I start?"

While this question is not one I can answer *for* you, I wanted to go ahead and put together a recommendation of the order of steps I would take if starting from scratch in my privacy journey today.

Please remember that not all threat models are equal, and not all people have the same priorities -- so be sure to take what is below (especially the order!) with a grain of salt and try to assess the best path for you, personally.
