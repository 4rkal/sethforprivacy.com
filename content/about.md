# About Me  

My name is Seth, and I've started this blog to give me a space for longer-form analysis, thought, and content.

My aim overall is to educate and learn more myself about where technology and privacy meet, and am deeply enthusiastic about the ability these technologies grant people to take back control of their data, and more broadly, their digital lives.

I am a site reliability engineer by day, but have fallen down the privacy and cryptocurrency rabbit holes as of late and will be focusing my posts on those two topics.

### PGP-verified identities

Below you can find verification of this DNS domain, my Github profile, my Matrix profile, and my Twitter account, all signed via PGP:

<https://keyoxide.org/55eec39e2efdd3740f94dffb6b9791c6214d1e57>  

## My Recommended Privacy Tools

### Monero  

[Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/) is a cryptocurrency that aims to be a privacy-preserving, decentralized, digital cash,
 allowing users to transact directly peer-to-peer without any trusted third parties while retaining strong privacy.

### Tor  

[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) is an anonymity network protocol that helps users avoid ISP and government network 
surveillance. It is the backbone of many privacy tools, and is a great initiative to help user's remain anonymous while 
online.

The Tor browser is the browser I would recommend people use for everyday browsing as it includes many default privacy protections by-default, while also sending all traffic natively over the Tor network.

### Signal  

[Signal](https://www.signal.org/) is an easy-to-use end-to-end encrypted messaging app, which allows people to easily 
communicate without revealing data to any intermediaries. While not perfect, it's a great first step to get people on 
the journey towards better online privacy, and I use it daily.

**NOTE: Signal has chosen to integrate a pre-mined and suspicious cryptocurrency into their platform, raising many concerns over leadership and financial vulnerability to governments and regulators. For more context, see my two Twitter threads [here](https://twitter.com/sethforprivacy/status/1379791201558278144?s=21) and [here](https://twitter.com/sethforprivacy/status/1382107861082386434?s=21).**

### Element/Matrix

[Element](https://element.io/) is an open-source cross-platform application for accessing the Matrix decentralized chat protocol. While there are other clients available, I've enjoyed the Element client on both desktop and mobile.

This is the primary way I prefer to do group chats, and is the way I stay involved with the Monero community on IRC as Element supports excellent native bridging.

I'm also going to work on spinnning up my own federated server for Matrix shortly, if time permits.

### Standard Notes

[Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org/) is a great encrypted notes app available across platforms that also accepts Monero for subscriptions. Extensions add a lot of power features including encrypted attachment uploads to your own WebDav server, like Nextcloud.

### Nextcloud

[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/athome/) is my personal cloud service of choice, and provides an easy to setup and use home cloud platform for storing files, photos, and much more with the plethora of community apps available.

## My Community Resources

### Opt Out, a FOSS and privacy-focused podcast

Opt Out is a podcast where I sit down with passionate people to learn why privacy matters to them, the tools and techniques they’ve found and leveraged, and where we encourage and inspire others towards personal privacy and data-sovereignty.

Check out my [announcement blog post]({{< ref "/content/posts/announcing-opt-out-podcast.md" >}}) for more info, or the podcast's website at [optoutpod.com](https://www.optoutpod.com/).

I also host a Peertube mirror of all Opt Out videos at <https://videos.optoutpod.com>.

### High-Performance Monero Node

I host a high-performance Monero node that is free to use for anyone, both as a p2p peer and a remote RPC for wallet usage:

- p2p: `node.sethforprivacy.com:18080`
- RPC (use this address in your wallet for a remote node): `node.sethforprivacy.com:18089` (Tor: `rbpgdckle3h3vi4wwwrh75usqtoc5r3alohy7yyx57isynvay63nacyd.onion:18089`)

### Tor Relay/Guard Node

I also host a Tor relay/guard node, available at the below address:

`tor.sethforprivacy.com:443`

[Node Statistics (Nickname: torsethforprivacy)](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#details/3CCEF96871A49AC06149E4AA8E14D270D881F6D3)

### Atomic Swap Rendezvous Node

The current atomic swap protocol provided by COMIT network uses rendezvous nodes as decentralized servers for discovering swap partners, offers, etc.

I run one of these nodes that you can use to discover current sellers of Monero, and you can use it as shown below:

Rendezvous node: 

`/dnsaddr/swap.sethforprivacy.com/p2p/12D3KooWCULyZKuV9YEkb6BX8FuwajdvktSzmMg4U5ZX2uYZjHeu`

```bash
./swap list-sellers --rendezvous-point /dnsaddr/swap.sethforprivacy.com/p2p/12D3KooWCULyZKuV9YEkb6BX8FuwajdvktSzmMg4U5ZX2uYZjHeu
```

If you run an ASB, please consider switching to using my rendezvous node instead of the original testing node:

Set `rendezvous_point` in your ASB `config.toml` to:

```conf
rendezvous_point = "/dnsaddr/swap.sethforprivacy.com/p2p/12D3KooWCULyZKuV9YEkb6BX8FuwajdvktSzmMg4U5ZX2uYZjHeu"
```
