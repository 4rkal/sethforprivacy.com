# About Me  

My name is Seth Simmons, and I've started this blog to give me a space for longer-form analysis, thought, and content.

My aim overall is to educate and learn more myself about where technology and privacy meet, and am deeply enthusiastic 
about the ability these technologies grant people to take back control of their data, and more broadly, their digital 
lives.

I am an information security engineer by day, but have fallen down the privacy and cryptocurrency rabbit holes as of 
late and will be focusing my posts on those two topics.

## My Recommended Privacy Tools

### Monero  

[Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/) is a cryptocurrency that aims to be a privacy-preserving, decentralized, digital cash,
 allowing users to transact directly peer-to-peer without any trusted third parties while retaining strong privacy.
 
### Tor  

[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) is an anonymity network protocol that helps users avoid ISP and government network 
surveillance. It is the backbone of many privacy tools, and is a great initiative to help user's remain anonymous while 
online. 

The Tor browser is the browser I would recommend people use for everyday browsing as it includes many default privacy protections by-default, while also sending all traffic natively over the Tor network.

### Signal  

[Signal](https://www.signal.org/) is an easy-to-use end-to-end encrypted messaging app, which allows people to easily 
communicate without revealing data to any intermediaries. While not perfect, it's a great first step to get people on 
the journey towards better online privacy, and I use it daily.

### Keybase  

[Keybase](https://keybase.io/) is another end-to-end encrypted messaging platform that is more fully featured than 
Signal while also boasting slightly better privacy and many more ways to engage other communities.

### Standard Notes

[Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org/) is a great encrypted notes app available across platforms that also accepts Monero for subscriptions. Extensions add a lot of power features including encrypted attachment uploads to your own WebDav server, like Nextcloud.

### Nextcloud

[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/athome/) is my personal cloud service of choice, and provides an easy to setup and use home cloud platform for storing files, photos, and much more with the plethora of community apps available.
